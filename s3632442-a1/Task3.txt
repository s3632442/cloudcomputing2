My motivation for A3 is to create a platform that helps users filter products according to their ethical orientation. 
The objective is to reduce the amount of research involved in an individual consumer's pursuit of spending habits 
that align with their ethical ideals and to enable users to help shape the world by voting with their wallets. 
The system components required will be db storage, scalable application hosting, load balancing, regional hosting redundancy.

I will probably write the application using Nodejs thus ideally I will use Elastic Beanstalk for app hosting, Amazon 
ElastiCache for rapid data resolution, S3 instances will be used for artefact hosting, Route 53 will do the routing for 
the api, serving, DNS resolution and github actions will be used to CICD integration. Ideally the API would be written using .NET core, hot chocolate, and graphQL. 

However, achieving a token amount of this to any level of proficiency or even to a basic level of functionality on my own 
seems like an enormous effort. Hence I will probably just have all computation performed on the front end within the local app instance 
which will query an Elastic Beanstalk instance using Amazon Relational Data Storage instance and and S3 instance.

There is the need for db storage for product information, user information, search functionality, comprehensive customer 
profile configuration, product profile configuration each with its own ui interface.

Realistically I would be happy to at least be able to match some mock users to some mock products and brands based on data drawn from a 
third party api and would like to focus more on the setup of a Continuous Delivery Continuous Deployment pipeline.
